    <h2>Background: Color</h2>

        The color purple is associated with a variety of meanings, including wisdom, creativity, royalty, power,
        ambition, and luxury. It can also represent magic, extravagance, peace, pride, independence, and wealth. As with
        other colors, purple is the subject of color psychology, which suggests that colors can have a powerful impact
        on moods and even behaviors.

    <div class="Butterfly">
        <p>Butterflies are winged insects from the lepidopteran suborder Rhopalocera, characterized by large, often
        brightly coloured wings that often fold together when at rest, and a conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group
        comprises the superfamilies Hedyloidea (moth-butterflies in the Americas) and Papilionoidea (all others). The
        oldest butterfly fossils have been dated to the Paleocene, about 56 million years ago, though they may have
        originated earlier.</p>
